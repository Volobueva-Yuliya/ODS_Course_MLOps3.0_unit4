The goal of this homework assignment is to set up a CI-CD pipeline and publish the project and research documentation to github pages. The pipeline should include:

1. DinD - building your docker image from the previous hw, it is also worthwhile to publish the image to your gitlab docker registry.
2. Lintering your code using your chosen linters and formatter.
3. Building and publishing your project as a package in your github pypi registry.
4. Building a study from quarto/jupyter, documentation in html (may need to download data using kaggle-cli).
5. Publishing on gitlab pages.
